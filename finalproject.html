            <h1>About Final Project </h1>
            <p id="aboutp1">
                Me and my partner, Alex Bergeron worked on the project together. The final project is based around the game Asteroids, without the shooting.
                There would be three waves of asteroids coming at the player, each wave getting faster. The player has to get up to 20000 points without getting hit once.
                The first wave has asteroids coming from the left, second wave coming from the right, and the last wave coming from the top. 
                Before you play, you can choose characters, which is either mine or Alex's bitmoji. The game is played by using the arrow keys and the point of the game is to avoid the asteroids.
